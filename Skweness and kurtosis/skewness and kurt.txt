For No-Skewness:

df[i].skew() (skewness) and df[i].kurt() (kurtosis) These values refer to Measure of Distribution and Outlier present in the data.


For Moderately Right Skew:

df[i].skew() (skewness) and df[i].kurt() (kurtosis) These values refer to Measure of Distribution and Outlier present in the data.

The Majority of data values lies in between math.floor(df[i].mode().tolist()[0]) and  math.ceil(df[i].mean())

The data lies in nearly normally distribution.

The',i, ' has Few of Outliers(Extream Values) --Suggestion (IQR Method)


For Moderately Left Skew:

df[i].skew() (skewness) and df[i].kurt() (kurtosis) These values refer to Measure of Distribution and Outlier present in the data.

The Majority of data values lies in between math.floor(df[i].mean()) and math.ceil(df[i].mode().tolist()[0])

The data lies in nearly normally distribution.

The ',i, '  has Few of Outliers(Extream Values) --Suggestion (IQR Method).


For Highly Right Skew:

df[i].skew() (skewness) and df[i].kurt() (kurtosis) These values refer to Measure of Distribution and Outlier present in the data.

The Majority of data values lies in between math.floor(df[i].mode().tolist()[0]) and  math.ceil(df[i].mean())

The data values decreases with increase of i

The i has Lot of Outliers(Extream Values) --Suggestion (Transformation or Scaling)
